Calorie Counter App

The calorie counter app allows people to keep track of the calorie intake.
There are three different ways in which this can be done.
- On the front page there is a section to enter a number of calories manually. Once the numbers are
  typed in, they can be added by hitting submit.
- Under that there are two button bars with three buttons on each. These six buttons have different values
  for each, and can be used as a quick option for adding calories.
- On the left of the header bar there is a button that brings up a list of foods. Each of these has a
  button with a value relating to the food on it. Hitting these will add that amount calories to the
  total.
  
 The app also has a BMI calculator. This is food my pressing the button at the right of the header bar.
 The users height is entered in meters and mass(weight) in kilograms and there BMI is returned.
